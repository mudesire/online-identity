I am Desire, Dr in engineering-physics with a specialization in computer vision (signal and image processing) in applied optics. In physics and signal processing, I am more specialized in industrial signals and industrial vision. And on the computer vision and machine learning side, in statistical analysis and satellite data for predicting agricultural yield.

On the programming side, I am rather a scientific developer for the development of scientific software, the digital model with python, c, c ++ and Qt / Opencv in vision studio. And I have experience in database and web development (like my site).
